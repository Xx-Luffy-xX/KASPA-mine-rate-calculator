# KASPA-mine-rate-calculator
A calculator for mining rate of Kaspa currency.

The code uses kaspactl to pull the current global hash-rate, then asks for the local (user's) hash-rate and calculates the mining-rate in terms of blocks and KAS.

Source code was written in python and compiled using pyinstaller package. You may download it, change it and recompile if you like.

Donations will be welcom at: kaspa:qzhxqtue7rq6r64vuvhxq3athj6jxj2kx6e94xdgc9ugt8ry34ptsnvst6cym

Cheers!
